# winnow-media

A Go library and Nix flake for running external media tools (ImageMagick,
FFmpeg, Poppler, pandoc and friends) from a pinned, reproducible tool
closure. Licensed under AGPL-3.0.

This repository currently contains the tool closure and the Go package that
finds it. Hardening and recipes are coming.

## The `tool` package

`github.com/davars/winnow-media/tool` resolves tool names to executable
paths.

- `tool.Resolve(name)` returns `<toolDir>/<name>` when a tool directory was
  injected at link time. It fails if that file is missing or not executable
  and never falls back to `PATH` in that case. With no injected directory
  (development builds) it returns `exec.LookPath(name)`.
- `tool.FlakeRevision()` returns the flake revision injected at link time,
  or `""` in development builds.

## Flake outputs

Systems: `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`.

- `packages.<system>.<tool>` for each of `exiftool`, `file`, `ffmpeg`,
  `imagemagick`, `poppler-utils`, `pandoc`, `catdoc` and `lynx`, taken
  unmodified from this flake's pinned nixpkgs.
- `packages.<system>.default`: a directory containing every program of all
  the tools, flat (`<dir>/magick`, not `<dir>/bin/magick`).
- `lib.toolDir { system, tools }`: the same kind of directory built from a
  named subset, e.g. `tools = [ "imagemagick" "ffmpeg" ]`. An unknown name
  fails evaluation.
- `lib.ldflags { system, tools }`: the `-ldflags` list that points the `tool`
  package at that directory and records the flake revision.
- `checks.<system>`: `test` (go test), `lint` (golangci-lint), `gofumpt`, and
  `closure`, which builds a small probe binary the way a consumer would and
  asserts that it resolves `magick` from the injected directory and that
  ImageMagick is in the binary's runtime closure.
- `devShells.<system>.default`: Go, golangci-lint, gofumpt and all the tools.

## Building a binary against the tools

```nix
{
  inputs.winnow-media.url = "github:davars/winnow-media";
  # Do not add: inputs.winnow-media.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, winnow-media, ... }:
    let system = "x86_64-linux"; pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}; in {
      packages.${system}.default = pkgs.buildGoModule {
        pname = "myapp";
        version = "0";
        src = ./.;
        vendorHash = "...";
        ldflags = winnow-media.lib.ldflags {
          inherit system;
          tools = [ "imagemagick" "ffmpeg" ];
        };
      };
    };
}
```

The injected tool directory's store path is embedded in the binary, so Nix's
reference scan includes the tools and their dependencies in the binary's
runtime closure (and in any container image built from it) without a
separate contents list.

## Rules for consumers

- **No `nixpkgs.follows` on this input.** The tools must come from this
  flake's own locked nixpkgs; following the consumer's would change the
  binaries underneath the library.
- **One revision for code and tools.** Pin the Go module in `go.mod` and the
  tools in `flake.lock` to the same commit of this repository.

## Development

```sh
nix develop          # Go, golangci-lint, gofumpt and the tools
nix flake check      # test, lint, gofumpt, closure
```

CI runs `nix flake check` on x86_64 and aarch64 Linux. A weekly workflow
opens a pull request updating `flake.lock`.
